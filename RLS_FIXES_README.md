# SweetCue RLS Policy and Streak Calculation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Violations

**Problem**: Users were unable to create reminders and gestures due to RLS policy violations. The error message was:
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "reminders"
```

**Root Cause**: The RLS policies were too restrictive and didn't properly handle the relationship between users, partners, and reminders/gestures.

**Solution**: Updated RLS policies to properly validate the relationship chain:
- User → Partner → Reminder/Gesture
- Added proper EXISTS clauses to check partner ownership
- Made gestures policies more permissive for user-created content

### 2. Incorrect Streak and Progress Calculation

**Problem**: The streak was only counting completed reminders from the current week, and progress wasn't accurately reflecting completed vs missed tasks.

**Root Cause**: 
- Streak calculation was too simplistic (just counting this week's completions)
- Progress calculation wasn't properly filtering by week
- Missing proper date handling for streak calculation

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper streak calculation that counts consecutive days with completed reminders
- Fixed progress calculation to properly filter by week
- Added better date handling and validation

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Schema Fixes
- `fix-reminders-rls.sql` - New file with comprehensive RLS policy fixes
- `fix-gestures-rls.sql` - Updated gestures RLS policies

### 2. Service Layer Improvements
- `src/services/reminders.ts` - Added partner validation and better error handling
- `src/services/gestures.ts` - Added partner validation and better error handling

### 3. UI Logic Fixes
- `src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Fixed streak and progress calculation

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema Fixes

Run the SQL files in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Run fix-reminders-rls.sql
-- This will update the RLS policies for both reminders and gestures tables
```

### Step 2: Restart the Application

The service layer improvements are already applied in the code. Restart your application to pick up the changes.

### Step 3: Test the Fixes

1. **Test Reminder Creation**: Try creating a new reminder through the dashboard
2. **Test Gesture Creation**: Try creating a gesture through the quick gifts feature
3. **Test Streak Calculation**: Complete some reminders and verify the streak updates correctly
4. **Test Progress Display**: Verify that completed vs missed tasks are displayed accurately

## Technical Details

### RLS Policy Changes

**Before**: Simple user_id checks
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own reminders" ON public.reminders
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**After**: Proper relationship validation
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own reminders" ON public.reminders
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = user_id AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.partners 
      WHERE partners.id = reminders.partner_id 
      AND partners.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### Streak Calculation Logic

**Before**: Simple count of this week's completions
```typescript
setStreak(completedThisWeek.length);
```

**After**: Consecutive days calculation
```typescript
// Calculate streak - count consecutive days with completed reminders
let currentStreak = 0;
const completedReminders = data.filter((r: any) => r.is_completed);

if (completedReminders.length > 0) {
  // Sort by completion date (most recent first)
  const sortedCompleted = completedReminders.sort((a: any, b: any) => {
    const dateA = new Date(a.completed_at || a.scheduled_date);
    const dateB = new Date(b.completed_at || b.scheduled_date);
    return dateB.getTime() - dateA.getTime();
  });
  
  // Check for consecutive days with completed reminders
  let checkDate = new Date(todayStartOfDay);
  for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) { // Check last 7 days
    const dayStart = new Date(checkDate.getFullYear(), checkDate.getMonth(), checkDate.getDate());
    const dayEnd = new Date(dayStart.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    
    const hasCompletedOnDay = sortedCompleted.some((r: any) => {
      const completedDate = new Date(r.completed_at || r.scheduled_date);
      return completedDate >= dayStart && completedDate < dayEnd;
    });
    
    if (hasCompletedOnDay) {
      currentStreak++;
    } else {
      break; // Streak broken
    }
    
    checkDate.setDate(checkDate.getDate() - 1);
  }
}
```

## Validation Steps

After applying the fixes, verify:

1. **Database**: Check that RLS policies are properly applied
2. **Authentication**: Ensure user authentication is working
3. **Partner Creation**: Verify partner profiles can be created
4. **Reminder Creation**: Test creating reminders with and without gestures
5. **Gesture Creation**: Test creating gestures through quick gifts
6. **Streak Display**: Verify streak shows consecutive days correctly
7. **Progress Display**: Check that completed/missed counts are accurate

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for detailed error messages in the browser console
2. **Verify Partner Data**: Ensure the user has a valid partner profile
3. **Check RLS Policies**: Verify the SQL policies were applied correctly
4. **Test Authentication**: Ensure the user is properly authenticated
5. **Database Permissions**: Verify the database user has proper permissions

## Future Improvements

Consider these additional improvements:

1. **Caching**: Add caching for partner data to reduce database calls
2. **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic retry logic for failed operations
3. **Offline Support**: Add offline capability for basic operations
4. **Performance**: Optimize database queries for better performance
5. **Analytics**: Add tracking for user engagement and feature usage
