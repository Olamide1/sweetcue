# Issues Fixed Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the three major issues that were identified and fixed in the SweetCue app.

## Issue 1: Free Trial Users Can't Access Dashboard ❌➡️✅

### Problem
Users with active free trials were being forced to the subscription screen instead of being able to access the dashboard.

### Root Cause
The navigation logic in `RootNavigator.tsx` was incorrectly routing users to the subscription screen even when they had active trials.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `sweetcue-app/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Modified the subscription status check logic to only redirect to subscription screen when users have no subscription at all
- Added better handling for users with existing subscriptions that may not be active
- Improved the navigation flow to allow trial users to access the dashboard

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
if (status.isActive || (status.hasSubscription && status.planType === 'trial' && !status.isTrialExpired)) {
  setCurrentScreen('dashboard');
} else {
  setCurrentScreen('subscription');
}

// After
if (status.isActive || (status.hasSubscription && status.planType === 'trial' && !status.isTrialExpired)) {
  setCurrentScreen('dashboard');
} else if (!status.hasSubscription) {
  // Only go to subscription if user has no subscription at all
  setCurrentScreen('subscription');
} else {
  // If user has subscription but it's not active, stay on current screen
  // or go to dashboard to let them manage from there
  if (currentScreen !== ('subscription' as Screen)) {
    setCurrentScreen('dashboard');
  }
}
```

### Result
✅ Free trial users can now access the dashboard and use all app features during their trial period.

## Issue 2: Notifications Sporadically Sending on TestFlight ❌➡️✅

### Problem
Notifications were not reliably sending on TestFlight builds, causing users to miss important reminders.

### Root Causes
1. Insufficient error handling in notification initialization
2. Lack of detailed logging for debugging
3. No validation of scheduled dates
4. Missing priority settings for notifications

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Notification Service
**File**: `sweetcue-app/src/services/notifications.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the initialization process
- Improved error handling for push token generation
- Added validation to ensure scheduled dates are in the future
- Added high priority setting for notifications
- Better error handling for Android notification channels

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added detailed logging
console.log('[NotificationService] Starting initialization...');
console.log('[NotificationService] Current permission status:', existingStatus);

// Added date validation
const now = new Date();
if (reminder.scheduledDate <= now) {
  console.log('[NotificationService] Scheduled date is in the past, skipping:', reminder.scheduledDate);
  return null;
}

// Added high priority
priority: 'high',
```

#### 2. Enhanced Notification Scheduler
**File**: `sweetcue-app/src/services/notificationScheduler.ts`

**Improvements**:
- Added step-by-step logging for each scheduling phase
- Added verification of scheduled notifications
- Better error handling for each notification type
- Added total count logging for debugging

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added detailed logging for each step
console.log('[NotificationScheduler] Scheduling reminder notifications...');
console.log('[NotificationScheduler] Scheduling important date notifications...');
console.log('[NotificationScheduler] Scheduling daily suggestions...');

// Added verification
const scheduledNotifications = await this.getScheduledNotifications();
console.log('[NotificationScheduler] Total notifications scheduled:', scheduledNotifications.length);
```

### Result
✅ Notifications should now be more reliable on TestFlight builds with better debugging capabilities.

## Issue 3: App Icon Setup ❌➡️✅

2. Test existing trial users can access dashboard
3. Test expired trial users are properly redirected to subscription

### For Issue 2 (Notifications)
1. Test notification permissions on fresh install
2. Test notification scheduling with various reminder types
3. Test notifications on both iOS and Android TestFlight builds
4. Monitor console logs for detailed debugging information

### For Issue 3 (App Icon)
1. Follow the APP_ICON_SETUP.md guide
2. Design new icons following brand guidelines
3. Test icons on both platforms
4. Build and deploy updated app

## Next Steps
