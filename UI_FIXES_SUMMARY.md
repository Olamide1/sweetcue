# SweetCue UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Activity Button Styling Issues

**Problem**: The "Activity" button in the dashboard header looked weird and broken, with inconsistent styling.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Improved Activity Button**: Updated styling with better colors, padding, and border radius
- ✅ **Enhanced "View All" Button**: Fixed the button in the progress section with better styling
- ✅ **Consistent Design**: Made both buttons follow the same design language

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before: Gray, small button
backgroundColor: theme.colors.neutral[100],
borderColor: theme.colors.neutral[200]

// After: Primary colored, larger button  
backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary[50],
borderColor: theme.colors.primary[200]
```

### 2. Sign-In Loading State Issues

**Problem**: There was a pause in the loading state before redirecting, which could encourage extra clicks.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Immediate Loading Feedback**: Set loading state immediately when button is pressed
- ✅ **Reduced Timeouts**: Shortened authentication timeouts from 300ms to 200ms
- ✅ **Faster Navigation**: Navigate to dashboard immediately instead of waiting for useEffect
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Added timeout for partner profile fetching to prevent hanging

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before: Long delays and potential hanging
while (!user && tries < 10) {
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 300));
}

// After: Faster, more responsive
const maxTries = 5; // Reduced from 10
const delay = 200; // Reduced from 300ms
```

### 3. Recent Activity Screen Improvements

**Problem**: The activity screen needed better styling and consistency.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Enhanced Back Button**: Better styling with proper borders and padding
- ✅ **Improved Cards**: Better shadows, spacing, and typography
- ✅ **Better Icons**: Larger, more prominent complete buttons
- ✅ **Consistent Spacing**: Better margins and padding throughout
